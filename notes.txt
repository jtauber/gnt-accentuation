Our starting assumption is that every Greek word has one and only one accent, an acute or circumflex, subject to the law of limitation.

However, in terms of the running text of the Greek New Testament, this is only true about 60% of the time.

In 54,818 cases out of the 137,544 words in the SBLGNT, the word either has:

  - **no** accent (17,652 times)
  - a single accent but a **grave** (36,077 times)
  - **two** accents (1,089 times)

Let's look in a little more detail at each of these.

## Part 1


### 1. No Accent

1.1 Uninflected foreign words that the editor has decided not to accent in the text:

αββα
γαββαθα
γολγοθα [@@@ the norm and lemma are accented, though---this is an inconsistency in MorphGNT]
εφφαθα
κουμ
ραββουνι
ταλιθα


1.2 Prepositions or conjunctions that are oxytones and end in a vowel that has been dropped due to the following word starting with a vowel:

1.2.1 Conjunctions:

ἀλλ’  from  ἀλλά
δ’    from  δέ
μηδ’  from  μηδέ
οὐδ’  from  οὐδέ

1.2.2 Prepositions:

ἀνθ’          from  ἀντί
ἀπ’   or ἀφ’  from  ἀπό
δι’           from  διά
ἐπ’   or ἐφ’  from  ἐπί
κατ’  or καθ’ from  κατά
μετ’  or μεθ’ from  μετά
παρ’          from  παρά
ὑπ’   or ὑφ’  from  ὑπό


1.3 The following single syllable prepositions:

εἰς
ἐκ or ἐξ
ἐν

[note norms and lemmas don't have accent either]


1.4 The following conjunctions:

εἰ                  εἰ
οὐ or οὐκ or οὐχ    οὐ
ὡς                  ὡς

[note norms and lemmas of εἰ, οὐ, and ὡς don't have accents but those of γέ, ποτέ, πού, πώς, and τέ below do by convention]


1.5 The following particles:

γε                  γέ
τε                  τέ


1.6 The following indefinite adverbs:

ποτε                ποτέ
που                 πού
πως                 πώς


1.7 The non-nominative, un-emphatic forms of ἐγώ and σύ:

μου
μοι
με

σου
σοι
σε

[sometimes the norms or these have accents by convention (the lemmas do, as they are nominative) but MorphGNT doesn't do this]


1.8 The masculine and feminine nominative articles (i.e. those with rough breathing):

ὁ
ἡ
οἱ
αἱ


1.9 The indefinite τις:

τις
τι
τινα
τινας
τινες
τινι
τινος
τινων
τισιν

[note that these are usually expressed in the norm with a grave for single syllable words and a final acute for two syllable words (except τινῶν which uses a circumflex)]


1.10 Two-syllable, present forms of εἰμί or φημί:

εἰμι
εἰσιν
ἐσμεν
ἐστε
ἐστι or ἐστιν

φημι
φησιν
φασιν [doesn't actually appear in our text]

[note that these are usually, by convention, expressed in the norm with a final acute]


Observe that, other than uninflected foreign words, the words that take no accent are a small, closed set. We will call this set of words "clitics", a term will will justify in Part 2 when we have understood them a little better. For now we will just take the term "clitic" to mean a word that potentially does not take any accent in running text.

All clitics in the SBLGNT fall into one of the categories listed above. To complete the first phase of this analysis, however, we must consider the converse. Are the clitics in the categories above ALWAYS unaccented?

Let's go category by category.

1.2: in all cases, where the vowel has not been dropped, the accent is there (although it's sometimes grave). Obviously in the cases where there is no vowel, there is no accent to put it on.

1.3: there is one case (out of 1754) where εἰς takes an acute and eight cases (out of 2733) where ἔν does. We'll explore those in Part 2.

1.4: οὐ in any of its forms never takes an accent in our text but εἰ does fairly often (76 out of 502) and ὡς twice (out of 503).

1.5: γε and τε don't take accents anywhere in our text.

1.6: ποτε (7 out of 29) and που (1 out of 4) sometimes take an accent. πως doesn't in our text.

1.7: με takes an acute once (out of 286), μοι four times (out of 225), and μου 10 times (out of 564). σοι takes an acute three times (out of 167), and σου also three times (out of 419). σε does not take an accent in our text. Notice that the accent is always an acute, never a grave.

1.8: all four forms of the rough-breathing article can take an acute accent in our text: ὁ (9 out of 2916), ἡ (4 out of 980), οἱ (4 out of 1112), and αἱ (1 out of 145).

1.9: all nine forms of τις can take accent, with the disyllabic forms taking either acute or grave (except for τινων which takes circumflex). The monosyllabic forms only take an acute if anything.

1.10: all forms of εἰμι and φημί can take an accent.
Unusually, however, the specific form ἐστι(ν) can take one either on the ultima (acute or grave) OR on the penult.


So, in summary, it appears that most of our clitics CAN take an accent in some circumstances (we'll explore exactly what those circumstances are in Part 2). There are a couple of generalizations to observe though:

a) if a clitic DOES take an accent, it's always an acute or grave on the final syllable, except:
b) τινων which only takes the circumflex
c) monosyllabic clitics never seem to take the grave, only the acute
d) ἐστι(ν) can take an acute on the penult as well as an acute or grave on the ultima.


### 2. Single Grave Accent

In the previous section, we introduced a small set of words, called "clitics" which, in the majority of cases, don't take an accent.

Here we will look at the cases where a word (clitic or otherwise) HAS an accent, but it's a grave.

We observe that, in ALL cases:

  - the grave is on the last syllable
  - the word in isolation would have an acute on the last syllable instead

Even a small sampling reveals there's nothing special about the words this happens to (unlike our clitics in the previous section).

We might hypothesize that, in running text, ALL final syllable acutes become graves but this is not true.

While there are 36,077 cases where an expected oxytone DOES have a grave, there are still 4,325 cases where it has an acute.

The cases where it has an acute fall into three categories:

2.1 the word is at the end of a clause (often indicated by punctuation but not always)

2.2 the word is an emphatic τίς or ἱνατί

2.3 the word *following* is a clitic

A closer look at 2.3 reveals this is only true of a subset of clitics: 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, and 1.10.

It appears that 1.3, 1.4 and 1.8 don't have this effect on the preceding word.

This suggests we might have two classes of clitic, those that effect the preceding word and those that don't.

Clitics that effect the preceding word:

1.5 The following particles: γε, τε
1.6 The following indefinite adverbs: ποτε, που, πως
1.7 The non-nominative, un-emphatic forms of ἐγώ and σύ: μου, μοι, με, σου, σοι, σε
1.9 The indefinite τις: τις, τι, τινα, τινας, τινες, τινι, τινος, τινων, τισιν
1.10 Two-syllable, present forms of εἰμί or φημί: εἰμι, εἰσιν, ἐσμεν, ἐστε, ἐστι or ἐστιν, φημι, φησιν, φασιν

Clitics that do *not* affect the preceding word:

1.3 The following single syllable prepositions: εἰς, ἐκ or ἐξ, ἐν
1.4 The following conjunctions: εἰ, οὐ or οὐκ or οὐχ, ὡς
1.8 The masculine and feminine nominative articles (i.e. those with rough breathing): ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, αἱ


We still need to test some converse cases. We classified the 4,325 cases where an oxytone keeps its acute into 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3 but are there cases where a word fits into one of those categories but still has a grave?

2.1 there seem to be 11 exceptions here:

Matt 26.36 : Γεθσημανὶ,
Luke 1.27  : Δαυὶδ,
Luke 2.51  : Ναζαρὲθ,
Luke 5.1   : Γεννησαρὲτ,
John 7.42  : Δαυὶδ,
John 7.42  : Δαυὶδ,
Acts 2.29  : Δαυὶδ,
Acts 9.19  : τινὰς,
1Cor 14.37 : ⸀ἐστὶν·
2Cor 1.19  : Οὒ,
2Pet 2.10  : Τολμηταὶ,

In 10 of them, the punctuation mark in question is a comma. In the remaining case, it seems an error in the base text (potentially caused by the text variation marker).

2.2 by definition, the words in this category have an acute

2.3 In how many cases is a word with a grave followed by a clitic that supposedly affects the preceding word?

[Well, first of all note that in the case of words preceding the subset of clitics that supposedly do NOT affect the preceding word, thousands of them have graves, seemingly confirming that subtype of clitic.]

Furthermore, we must note that the paroxytone ἔστιν is not a clitic by our definition above.

There are 16 cases where a word with a grave is followed by a clitic that should affect it.

In all cases the clitic is a form of εἰμί or φημί (i.e. a 1.10 clitic). Note there are hundreds (n?) of cases where the word preceding a 1.10 clitic has an acute. What is different about these 16 cases?

Let categorize them.

@@@ ??? Seven of them have a paroxytone ἔστιν. This is easy to explain: we should just not treat this form of ἐστίν as a clitic.

Matt 19.12 : καὶ εἰσὶν
Matt 19.12 : καὶ εἰσὶν
Luke 13.30 : ἰδοὺ εἰσὶν
Luke 13.30 : καὶ εἰσὶν
John 6.64  : ἀλλὰ εἰσὶν
John 8.58  : ἐγὼ εἰμί.
John 18.29 : καὶ ⸀φησίν·
Acts 10.31 : καὶ φησί·
Acts 17.28 : καὶ ἐσμέν,
Acts 22.2  : καὶ φησίν·
Acts 23.18 : καὶ φησίν·
Eph 2.19   : ἀλλὰ ⸀ἐστὲ
Col 2.10   : καὶ ἐστὲ
1John 3.01 : ⸂καὶ ἐσμέν⸃.
1John 5.20 : καὶ ἐσμὲν
Rev 1.19   : ἃ εἰσὶν
@@@

### 3. Two accents

There are 1,089 times in the SBLGNT where a word has two accents.

These fall in to two categories:

356  CA
733 A-A

Note two things:

1) the second accent is always an acute on the ultima (never a grave or circumflex)
2) two consecutive acutes are never found (AA is not possible)

We notice a particularly interesting pattern if we look not only at the accentuation in running text, but what the normalized accentuation in isolation would be in these cases:

356    CA    C-
733   A-A   A--

In other words, the CA pattern only appears for words that are normally properispomena and the A-A pattern only appears for words that are proparoxytones.

The final acute is just ADDED to the normal accentuation of the word. Clearly this accent is NOT added if:

1) the word already has an accent on the final syllable; or
2) the word is a paroxytone (i.e. has an acute on the penult, because that would lead to an AA pattern)

Note that C- and A-- *do* occur in the running text (7,458 and 17,387 times respectively) so the extra accent doesn't happen in *all* cases.

What is special about the 356 cases of CA and 730 cases of A-A?

Well, it may not surprise you that in all cases, they are followed by clitics that affect the previous word:

1.5:
γέ [2]
τέ [50]

1.6:
ποτέ [7]

1.7:
ἐγώ: μου [173] or μού [3]
ἐγώ: μοι [116]
ἐγώ: με [133]

σύ: σου [134] or σού [2]
σύ: σοί [1] or σοι [55]
σύ: σε [72]

1.9:
τις: τις [23]
τις: τί [2] or τι [24]
τις: τινα [13]
τις: τινας [3]
τις: τινες [11]
τις: τινι [2]
τις: τινος [2]

1.10:
εἰμί: εἰμι [11]
εἰμί: εἰσιν [41]
εἰμί: ἐσμεν [6]
εἰμί: ἐστε [16]
εἰμί: ἐστι [1] or ἐστιν [183]


There are a couple of other cases but these seems to be mistakes in the text:

030820: θέλοντές⸃. ὁ
040734: ⸀εὑρήσετέ, καὶ
040736: ⸀εὑρήσετέ, καὶ

see https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt/issues/53


We need to now test the converse. Do clitics that affect the preceding word, always add an extra accent if that preceding word is a properispomenon or proparoxytone?

Fully expected:

1163 --A --A    no surprises there, already oxytone so do nothing
431  --C --C    no surprises there, already has final accent

943  -A- -A-    can't take the accent because AA not allowed

356  -CA -C-    the cases we talked about above
730  A-A A--    the cases we talked about above


Needs explanation:

154  --- ---    εἰ, οὐκ, or punctuation preceding
  4  --- --A    ἀλλ’ [3] or punctuation preceding

126  --A ---    clitics that have gained back their accent (we'll talk about these in part 2)
10  --A --G    clitics (in this case τις)

Didn't take accent but should have?

  4  -C- -C-

  030810 συνιῶσιν. Ἔστιν
  041029 μεῖζων⸃ ἐστιν,
  070807 γνῶσις· τινὲς
  271718 εἶδες ἔστιν

In two cases above, punctuation intervenes. In εἶδες ἔστιν, ἔστιν is not a clitic. Is "041029 μεῖζων⸃ ἐστιν," a mistake? @@@

  18  A-- A--

In 12 cases, it's punctuation:

  011911 δέδοται. εἰσὶν
  012746 ἐγκατέλιπες; τινὲς
  040501 Ἱεροσόλυμα. ἔστιν
  041313 λέγετε, εἰμὶ
  051717 παρατυγχάνοντας. τινὲς
  052123 λέγομεν· εἰσὶν
  052522 ⸀Αὔριον, φησίν,
  052625 μαίνομαι, φησίν,
  150605 ⸀εὐσέβειαν. ἔστιν
  170309 περιΐστασο, εἰσὶν
  230516 θάνατον. ἔστιν
  271613 βάτραχοι· εἰσὶν

In two cases it's non-clitic ἔστιν:

  050215 μεθύουσιν, ἔστιν
  051902 ἅγιον ἔστιν

This leaves:

  031821 νεότητος ⸀μου.
  041431 ⸀ἐνετείλατο μοι
  052631 ἄξιον⸃ ⸀τι
  190406 ἀπολείπεται τινὰς

Three of which could be errors due to textual variants and the other just a straight out error?


Some remaining cases:

 17  --C -C-    these are just τοῦτ’ < τοῦτο
 6   -A- --A    these are just ἔστιν
 23  --G --A

Most of these were identified earlier:

011912 καὶ εἰσὶν
011912 καὶ εἰσὶν
012142 καὶ ἔστιν
021211 καὶ ἔστιν
031330 ἰδοὺ εἰσὶν
031330 καὶ εἰσὶν
040664 ἀλλὰ εἰσὶν
040858 ἐγὼ εἰμί.

051728 καὶ ἐσμέν,
